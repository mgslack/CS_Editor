    <p>The CS_Editor allows one to open and edit save games created by Iron Tower Studio's Colony Ship.
       The editor will open with a empty character screen. Once a save game is selected (open save),
       the editor will prompt for the main character's name (the PC), then load the main character's
       stats into the window along with selected counts of inventory items.  Skills, HPs, Attributes
       and XP are then loaded to the character editor panel for the main PC character, along with
       inventory amounts of credits, med kits and ammo.  To select one of the companions potentially
       available in a save game, they are accessible via the 'find char' button.  All known companions
       are listed (including the main PC) in the drop down.  Note though, not all will be available in
       the save game at certain states of the game (may get a 'character not found' message).</p>
    <p>The inventory can only be edited while editing the main PC.  For the companions, the inventory
       fields are disabled.  The reason is simple, the main PC in the save file holds the inventory.
       The inventory amounts are limited to 5,000,000 credits (way, way, way above what can be gotten
       ever, naturally, in game play), 50000 med kits (same as in game), 10,000 of each type of ammo.
       Believe the game is capped below that amount.  Typically, would not go above 100,000 for credits
       and above 2000 or so for each ammo type.  Note, if you do not have credits, med kits or one or
       more of the ammo types, you won't be able to change the amount of that item, since you don't
       have any in inventory.  The editor will not add the item to the save game if you don't have
       any to begin with.</p>
    <p>You can only select campanions that are companions in your game, so mutually exclusive
       companions, like your faction campanion, will be available, the others will not be found in your
       save file.  You can edit Romeo, but generally shouldn't.  Not sure what that will do to the
       game if you change skills or tag one or more.  But should be able to update HP or experience,
       though may not do anything in the game.</p>
    <p>The editor is pretty simple.  Can open a save game file, find a character to edit and edit
       some of the skills, attributes and other information for the character.  Can not add/change items or
       other data, just skills, skill exp, tagged, attributes, current HP and XP.  Editor will cap
       skills and attributes similarly to what the game does.</p>
    <p>Note, the character's experience is the total experience earned.  The game determines the amount
       of experience needed for the next level based on a variety of traits taken and other factors.
       So adding one point of experience may be displayed as two points closer to the next level.
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Game Options:</div>
    <p>There are no real options to set or configure for the CS editor.  The program does save off
       the main window position when exiting the program and saves the directory last loaded
       a CS save game from and will save off last entered main PC name.</p>
