    <p>The CS_Editor allows one to open and edit save games created by Iron Tower Studio's Colony Ship.
       The editor will open with a empty character screen, from there, open a save game file and then find
       the character to edit.  Skills, HPs, Attributes and XP are then loaded to the character editor panel
       for the searched for character.  The companions potentially available in a save game are listed
       in the drop down.  Note though, not all will be available in the save game at certain states.</p>
    <p>The editor is pretty simple.  Can open a save game file, find a character to edit and edit
       some of the skills, attributes and other information for the character.  Can not add/change items or
       other data, just skills, skill exp, tagged, attributes, current HP and XP.  Editor will cap
       skills and attributes similarly to what the game does.</p>
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Game Options:</div>
    <p>There are no real options to set or configure for the LoX editor.  The program does save off
       the main window position when exiting the program and saves the directory last loaded
       a CS save game from.</p>
