# CS_Editor

First new project done using VS 2022 and .net core 6.0.  Usually would've used 4.7 or 4.8 windows forms frameworks,
but forgot to install before starting project.

Program is a simple character editor for the game Colony Ship (as of Oct 2022, still in EA status).  Can edit attributes,
skills (exp and tagged or not), HPs and XP for created character and companions.  Editor has not been extensively tested,
so 'USE AT YOUR OWN RISK'.  There is help with the editor, but is sorely lacking in details at this time.  Will flesh it
out as time wears on.
