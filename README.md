# CS_Editor

First new project done using VS 2022 and .net core 6.0.  Usually would've used 4.7 or 4.8 windows forms frameworks,
but forgot to install before starting project.

Program is a simple character editor for the game Colony Ship (as of Oct 2022, still in EA status).  Can edit attributes,
skills (exp and tagged or not), HPs and XP for created character and companions.  Editor has not been extensively tested,
so 'USE AT YOUR OWN RISK'.  There is help with the editor, but is sorely lacking in details at this time.  Will flesh it
out as time wears on.

Note, added functionality to allow one to edit certain inventory amounts when editing stats for the main, created PC.
Allow editing amounts of credits, med kits and ammo, if have any in inventory of the save game editing.  Again, editor
has not been extensively tested, so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK (and back up saves before using).
